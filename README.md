**Team Members**: Kamaria Nixon, Phillip Miller, Matthew Williams, Kevaughn Dixon, Mark Gbalazeh

## Inspiration
With the Outbreak of the COVID-19 virus many gyms have been closed but people still need to stay fit
So we thought this application would be very useful during these challenging times
to help people stay fit and healthy


## What it does
This chatbot allows users to find exercises and get workout advice from the Fit Sensei


## List your Chatbot’s features and use cases
1. Lose weight
2. Get Workout
3. Find Exercises
4. Track Progress


## How we built it
Tech Stack & Documentation:
* We used the language Pyhton to interact with the Facebook API and send messages to the user
* Pyhton's SQLite was used for database features found in the Chatbot


## Challenges we ran into
1. It was difficult at times for us to all meet up and work as a team due to varying work schedules
2. Another Challenge we had was handling how to calculate the work plan the user should get to provide good workout advice
 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We are really proud of being able to work with the Facebook API and create a bot that one can actually use on the Internet
* It also brings us great joy to create an application that can improve someone's quality of life as health is very important aspect of life


## What we learned
* We learned about the Facebook API, webhooks and how to make chatbots
* We also learned how to program in Python


## What's next for “Fit Sensei”
